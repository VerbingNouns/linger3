# Linger3
 Updating and expanding on the much-beloved Linger psycholinguistics software, with the (failed) goal of creating and 'releasing' Linger3 in 2020.

# What is Linger?

[Linger](https://web.archive.org/web/20190911030030/http://tedlab.mit.edu:80/~dr/Linger/readme.html) (lost to link rot: http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Linger/ but archived on the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20191220181934/http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Linger/)) is a piece of software for gathering online and offline psycholinguistic data, developed by TedLab and Doug Rohde (2001-2003). However, in 2019, it is still widely used and powerful but no longer supported. I am adapting and updating Linger to be more flexible, powerful, and user-friendly in my capacity as a research support scientist at Newcastle University.

# Update log

**Linger v2.96**:
- updated `clock clicks` to `clock clicks -milliseconds` as suggested by [Ken Nakatani (2017)](https://www.konan-u.ac.jp/hp/nakatani/lingernote.html).
- added preference option `QuestionsFirst` to allow control of the order that ratings are collected with respect to any questions (lines with `?` and `!` headers, e.g.).
- changed multiple choice options to be displayed vertically rather than in a grid with two columns
